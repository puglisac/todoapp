## Todo App

This is a simple todo app.  Run the app by opening index.html in your browser. Create a todo item by typing in the text field.  Mark items off by clicking and undo by clicking them again. You can delete items completely by clicking the delete button

This todo app was created for the local storage assignment at Springboard. This app uses javascript for the logic and stores the todo items in local storage.
